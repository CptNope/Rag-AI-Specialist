Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is revolutionizing how organizations manage knowledge and compliance. Today, we're excited to launch the **RAG AI Specialist**, an open-source agent tailored for NIST SP 800-171 auditors.

## Why RAG for Compliance?

Traditional AI assistants risk exposing Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) if not properly sandboxed. Our RAG AI Specialist uses a **permissioned blockchain** for tamper-evident logs and a **sanitized vector store** to ensure no raw CUI is ever indexed.

## Key Features

- **Full NIST 800-171 Coverage**: Pre-loaded catalog of ~90 controls with metadata and code mappings.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Easily add system-specific audits, from SSH configurations to Windows registry checks.
- **Federated Learning**: Agents securely share summaries and embeddings over MQTT, creating a network of specialized auditors.
- **Memory Optimization**: Clustering and summarization pipeline prevents vector-store bloat and keeps the agentâ€™s knowledge fresh.

## Getting Started

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/CptNope/rag-ai-specialist.git`
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure: Edit YAMLs in `config/` for your environment.
4. Run: `docker-compose up -d`
